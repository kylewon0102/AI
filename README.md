## Overview

This repository aggregates 50+ machine learning and deep learning mini-projects designed to explore diverse modeling paradigms and real-world problem settings.

Projects span:

- Supervised learning (classification & regression)
- Sequence modeling (RNN / LSTM)
- Computer vision (CNN / transfer learning)
- Generative modeling (GANs)
- Reinforcement learning

All experiments were implemented in Python using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Approach

Each mini-project follows a consistent pipeline:

1. Dataset preprocessing & normalization  
2. Model architecture design  
3. Training & hyperparameter tuning  
4. Evaluation using task-appropriate metrics  
5. Visualization of loss / accuracy curves  

Representative architectures include:

- CNN + Transfer Learning (ResNet / VGG)
- LSTM for time-series & NLP
- DQN for reinforcement learning
- GANs for image generation

## Results

Across projects, models achieved competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

Example outputs include:

- Classification accuracy curves  
- Regression loss convergence  
- Reinforcement learning reward trajectories  

Graphs and training logs are provided for selected projects.

## Key Takeaways
